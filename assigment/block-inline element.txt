
what is differnce between a block-level elements and an inline elements ?
ans:
    block-level elements:
                         a block level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space(a margin) before amd after the element 


                        
                         a block level element always takes up the full width available (stretchs out to the left and right as far as it can)

                         two commonly used block element are:<p>and <div>.

                         the <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

                         the <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document

                         the <p> element is a block level element.

                         the <div> element is a block level element.

     inline element:                    
                    an inline element does nit start on a new line.

                    an inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

                    this is a<span> element inside a paragraph.
